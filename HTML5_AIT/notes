INTRODUCTION TO HTML
--------------------
    - To learn the basic concept of HTML5.
    - To study structure of web page.
    - To study HTML5<audio>, <video> and <canvas>.
    - To learn Version Compatibility.
    - To understand the concept of svg(Scalable Vector Graphics).
==================================================================
    
    There are three organization that are currently in change of the specification of HTML5
        - WHATWG(web hypertext application technology)
        - W3C(World Wide Web Consortium)
        - IETF(Internet Engineering Task Force)


Features of HTML5
================= 
    HTML5 introduce a number of new element and attributes that can help us
    in building modern websites.

   -  New Semantic Elements
        <header> 
        <footer>
        <selection> ect.

   - Forms 2.0 
        <input>

   - Persistance Logical Storage     

   - WebSocket

   - Server Sent Event

   - Canvas

   - Audio and video

   - Geolocation

   - Microdata

   - Drag and Drop

==========================================================================================

Semantic element in HTML5

    Different web pages/websites look different; they all possess a basic common structure.
    to follow the common structure and semantic, HTML5 provides dedicated element. 
    for example
        <header>
        <nav>
        <section>
        <aside>
        <article>
        <footer>

    A sample HTML5 document structure can be below
|---------------------------------------------------|
|                                                   |
|                 <header>                          |
|                                                   |
----------------------------------------------------|
|                                                   |
|                 <nav>                             |
|                                                   |
----------------------------------------------------|
|                            |                      |
|    <section>               |                      |
|                            |                      |
|----------------------------|       <aside>        |
|                            |                      |
|    <article>               |                      |
|                            |                      |
|---------------------------------------------------|
|                                                   |
|                <footer>                           |
|                                                   |
|---------------------------------------------------|

<header>

<article>

<main>

<nav>

<section>

<aside>

<address>

===================================================================

form new element
----------------

    html5 introduced a number of form attributes some of them are
    <detalist>
    <keygen>
    <output>
    <progress>
    <meter>

===================================================================

form new attributes
-------------------

  - autocomplete
  - autofocus
  - form
  
  - formaction : The formaction attributes can be used to override the action attributes of the <form> 
                element and to specify the URL of a file that will process the input control when the form is submitted.

  - formenctype: The formenctype a attributes specifies how the form data should be encoded when submitted

  - formmethod :
  - formnovalidate:
  - formtarget:
  
  - height and width:
  - list
  - min and max
  - multiple
  - pattern
  - placeholder
  - required
  - step

==================================================================================================

<audio> and <video>
--------------------

    The html5 <audio> and <video> tags are makes it easy to add media to a website.
    we need to set src attribute to find the media source and include a controls attribute 
    so the user can play and pause the media.

    <audio>
        The recently introduced HTML5 <audio> element provides a standard way to embed audio in web pages. however,the <audio> element is relatively new but it works in most of the modern web browser.

    * attributes of <audio> and <video> element
    -------------------------------------------
        1.Preload
        2.autoplay
        3.loop
        4.muted
        5.mediagroup
        6.controls
        7.src
        8.height
        9.width
        10.poster

    * understanding the <video>/<audio> events 
    --------------------------------------------
       1. abort
       2. canplay
       3. ended
       4. error
       5. loadeddata
       6. loadstart
       7. pause
       8. play
       9. progress
       10.ratechange
       11.seeked
       12.seeking
       13.suspend
       14.volumechange
       15.waiting

<canvas>
---------

    The <canvas> tag in HTML is used to draw graphics on a web page using javascript.
    it can be used to draw path,boxes,text,gradient and adding images. By default it 
    does not contain borders and text.

    The canvas was originally introduced by apple for the mac os dashboard widget and 
    to power graphics in the safari web browser. Later it was adopted by firefox, Google Chrome 
    and Opera. Now the canvas is a part of the new HTML5 specification for next generation web technologies.

  How to create a HTML canvas?
    A canvas is a rectangle like area on an HTML page it is specified with canvas element.
    by default the canvas element has no border and no content, it is like a container.

    <canvas id = "mycanvas" width="200" height="3000"> </canvas>

    we can fill color inside the canvas shape using the fillstyle() method.

    while styling the shapes on canvas, it is recommended to use the fill() method before the
    stroke() method in order to render the stroke correctly.

    
    * method and properties of <canvas>
    -----------------------------------
    Properties:
        fillStyle
        strokeStyle
        shadowColor

        shadowOffsetX
        shadowOffsetY

        lineCap()    
        lineJoin()
        lineWidth()

    Rectangle Method
        rect()
        fillRect()
        strokeRect()    
        clearRect()

    path Method    
        fill()
        stroke()

    Canvas vs SVG
   ****************
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                SVG                                                     Canvas
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - it is object model based                              |   - it is pixel based
    
    - it is suitable for using larger rendering area        |   - suitable for small rendering
    
    - svg provides any support for event handlers           |   - canvas not provides any resource for event hndlr
    
    - modification is allowed through script and css        |   -  modification allowed through script only
    
    - svg has better scalability                            |   -  canvas has poor scalability
    
    - svg is vector based                                   |   -  canvas is raster based
    
    - is not suitable for game graphics                     |   - is suitable for game graphics
    
    - svg does not depend on resolution                     |   - canvas is completely dependent on resolution
    
    - svg is capable for API animation                      |   - canvas has no API for animation
    
    - svg is suitable for printing with high                |   - canvas is not suitable for printing high quality
      quality and any resolution                                  and high resolution

    Introduction to version compatibility
    -------------------------------------

        There are three main aims of HTML5
            1. Specifying current browser behaviors that are interoperable.
            2. defining error handling for the first time
            3. evolving the language for easier authoring of web application.

=================================================================================

    Installation of Apache Tomcat (xampp/lampp/mysql)
    --------------------------------------------------
        
        * Basic packages include system, programming & server Software
            apache      : from the web server
            mysql       : the widely used, free, open-source
            php         : The programming language
            perl        : The programming language
            proFTPD     : An FTP server
            OpenSSL     : for secure socket layer support
            phpMyAdmin  : for MySql admin
